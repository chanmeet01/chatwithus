 about ChatWithUs:
 ChatWithUs is an AI powered chatting and tracking website that helps people with mental problems to talk to mental health professionals, and track their emotions, issues faced, and symptoms to mental health issues if the user suspects if they have any. It is a community based website, so people can make their accounts and even talk to each other in the community as well. The users, according to their experiences and symptoms/problems, can recieve help from the website to identify the problem from root and help them with probable solutions. It aims to contain various features like mindfulness exercises, community support, professional help, articles to provide genuine and tested temporary solutions to issues until help is on the way, etc. It also aims to provide an AI chatbot which can give personalized peer support. 
Users can create accounts and maintain it, also we are thinking to add tags to the user profiles in order to identify each other's problems without stigmatizing it. 
They can log their mood daily, have access to articles, videos, and other resources on mental health topics. 
Includes guided meditation and breathing exercises.
Community support includes: creating a forum or chat feature for peer support.
In case things go out of hands for some users where this platform is not afraid to discuss difficult topics like suicide prevention, we provide a directory of mental health professionals and emergency contacts.
